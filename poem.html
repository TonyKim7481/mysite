    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
    Then there's a pair of us! <br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
    <br>
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>
    How public - like a Frog - <br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
    To an admiring Bog!</p>
    <br>
    <p>By <i>Emily Dickinson (1891)</i></p>
